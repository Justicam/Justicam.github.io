summary: HDOT found an RDP connection issues with cloning devices and Windows 25H2. I worked on a project to create an enterprise master image in order to avoid cloning and successfully deploy 50+ laptops without any RDP issues.

We started by factory resetting a state laptop and updating it to 25H2.
