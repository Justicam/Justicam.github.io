Surprisingly, despite being a Computer Engineering major, software engineering has not been a central focus of my studies. My primary career goal is in Cybersecurity, but I recognize the significant benefits of learning software engineering. Software engineering emphasizes the creation of high-quality software, the importance of secure design in system architectures, and the practice of secure coding. Which are essential skills for a successful career in Cybersecurity. Understanding software development will not only broaden my technical expertise but also enhance my ability to safeguard systems against vulnerabilities.

## Specific Interests
Specific topics in software engineering that interest me include the Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), which stresses the importance of integrating security measures throughout each phase of the development process, from design and coding to testing and maintenance. I am particularly drawn to threat modeling, where I can identify and understand potential threats during the design phase, enabling proactive security measures. Additionally, the ability to detect, analyze, and address security vulnerabilities within software systems fascinates me. I aim to become highly proficient in coding, so I can conduct code reviews, identifying security flaws and potential bugs that could lead to exploits.

## Future skills and experiences
In the future, I aspire to develop expertise primarily in secure coding practices, encryption and cryptography, authentication and authorization techniques, and software vulnerability detection. These skills, gained through a strong foundation in software engineering, will be instrumental in achieving my ultimate career goal: excelling in the field of cybersecurity. Mastering these areas will not only enhance my technical proficiency but also ensure that I am well-prepared to protect systems from emerging threats and vulnerabilities, aligning with the career path I am passionate about.
