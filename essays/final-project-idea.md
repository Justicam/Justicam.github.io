## Overview
Students at UH Manoa often struggle with commuting. Parking is limited, expensive, and hard to find. While public transportation isn’t always convenient for everyone. As a result, many students drive alone, which adds to traffic, raises transportation costs, and increases carbon emissions.
My solution, UH Manoa Ride Share, connects students with similar routes and schedules to make carpooling easier. This app helps students save on commuting costs, eases parking demand, and reduces environmental impact. It encourages safe and convenient ride sharing. Creating a sustainable and collaborative way to get around.

## Mockup page ideas
### Welcome Page
The app helps students save on commuting, connect with peers, and reduce the campus’s carbon footprint. With sign-up and log-in options, new users can register, while returning users can log in with ease. The app includes simple, visual steps to guide users in posting or finding a ride and connecting with others. Student testimonials add an extra layer of trust, showcasing the app’s community value and encouraging new users to join the shared transportation network.

### Dashboard
The User Profile Summary shows each user's photo, name, and basic info, including ride preferences and ratings. The Ride Options section provides tabs for “Offered Rides” and “Requested Rides,” displaying active rides that match the user’s interests. Notifications keep users updated on upcoming rides, messages, and ride confirmations. Eco-Impact Stats allow users to track their environmental contributions, including carbon footprint reductions, miles saved, and other impact metrics.

### Ride Posting Page
The form includes fields for trip details, such as pickup location, destination, date, time, and seat availability. There’s also a Recurring Option with a checkbox to mark the ride as recurring, allowing customization for specific days like Mon/Wed/Fri. A Cost Suggestion Calculator automatically estimates suggested gas costs based on distance to encourage fair contributions.

### Ride Search Page
The Search Bar and Filters allow users to narrow down rides based on location, time, date, driver preferences (like non-smoking), and seat availability. The Ride Results List displays rides matching the search criteria, showing key details like the driver’s name, profile picture, pickup time, and location. For easy visualization, a Map View shows the pickup and drop-off points on an embedded map.

### User Profile Page
This displays the user’s personal information, ride preferences, past ride history, and ratings received. The Ride History section lists all previous rides along with the ratings received, promoting transparency and accountability among users.

## Use case ideas
### Commuting Students
Sarah is a UH Manoa student who drives to campus every morning. She posts her commute details on UH Manoa Ride Share and matches with two students on her route. They agree on a shared fuel cost, and Sarah now carpools to campus, cutting her expenses and reducing parking struggles.

### Reduce Environmental Impact
Members track their impact stats and earn eco-badges by consistently using the app, reducing individual car usage, and promoting eco-friendly behavior. 

### Students with Similar Schedules
Rachel has a recurring class schedule on Tuesdays and Thursdays and posts it on the app as a recurring ride. Josh who has a similar class schedule, sees her listing and joins her carpool for the semester. Building a reliable ride sharing arrangement.

## Beyond the basics
### Carpool Mapping
The app’s dynamic map integration features pickup and drop off points along with route suggestions, estimated travel times, and live traffic updates. This optimizes routes, helping users save time and adjust to traffic conditions for a smoother commuting experience.

### Community Board for Events
The Community Board lets students post about events they’re attending, such as study groups, volunteer activities, or campus meetups, and offer rides for these occasions. This feature encourages spontaneous carpooling and promotes greater community engagement.

### Safety Enhancements
Implement location sharing features during rides so that students can share their trip with a trusted contact. This would include the option for real time tracking, ensuring additional safety during commutes.
