I spent the first 3.5 years of college learning C, which provided me with a strong foundation in programming. However, transitioning to TypeScript has been a truly eye opening experience. While the learning curve was initially steep, given the new syntax and methods for defining code or printing strings. The underlying logic from C remained consistent, which helped ease the transition. 

I particularly gained a lot from learning ES6, especially in terms of structuring objects and utilizing functions effectively. One feature I noticed is how seamlessly TypeScript integrates with the JavaScript ecosystem and modern IDEs, making the development process more dynamic and user-friendly, particularly for web applications. This stands in contrast to C, which, although supported by excellent tooling, doesn't take full advantage of modern IDE features.

## Software Engineering perspective
C lacks many of the features that TypeScript offers, largely because it is a lower level language designed primarily for system programming and performance optimization. Its syntax tends to be more verbose and less intuitive, particularly for tasks like web or application development. In contrast, TypeScript proves to be more user friendly, especially in the context of modern web development, where rapid iteration and advanced language features are critical. With TypeScript, features like static typing, better error handling, and integration with JavaScript frameworks significantly enhance productivity and streamline the development process.

I found athletic software engineering to be highly effective in sharpening my problem-solving skills. Personally, when an exercise is timed and there's something at stake, Iâ€™m driven to put forth my utmost effort. Even after failure, I always come away having learned something valuable. The practice WODs were particularly useful in preparing me for the actual WODs, as they provided a clear understanding of the structure and expectations. Although the process can be stressful, I believe that placing myself under pressure is a key motivator that ultimately helps me achieve my goals.

## Conclusion
I find TypeScript to be a highly efficient language, offering great flexibility. Its modern features, such as classes, modules, arrow functions, and async/await, not only enhance functionality but also contribute to writing clean, easy-to-read code. One of the aspects I particularly appreciate is not having to manage manual memory allocation and deallocation, which can be very annoying in C. This allows me to focus more on building applications and less on managing the technical aspects of memory management, making the development process more streamlined and enjoyable.
